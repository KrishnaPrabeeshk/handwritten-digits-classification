# handwritten-digits-classification
The projects main objective is to identify which digit is being shown in handwritten format .
I have used the dataset from keras , then scaled and flattened the data .
I have used neural network approach to get the job done by first training the network and then testing it's performance . 
I have also built and visualised the confusion matirx and tested what happens if we add an additional hidden layer .
I have even used CNN for better result and compared the results of both ann and cnn.
